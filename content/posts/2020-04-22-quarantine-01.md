Yeah, here we are at the worst modern crisis that I hope live. Yes, dear reader, I'm at 2020, it's the COVID-19 crisis.

So, my university (UFMG) has paralyzed the classes, even web classes, so this is the time for personal project development, all forward, right?

Well, this is what I wanted, but it's very unrealistic. Most of the free time that we have gained isn't quality free time, and since I'm self-isolating in Belo Horizonte, away from my family that is in another state, I pass all my day at home.

So, this isn't a time for productivity.

However, I've done some electronics and coding work just for enjoyment. I'll list some of them:

- Replace a Nerf gun LED with a LASER. (ok, I've already checked this, and I'll make some posts)
- Build a Vaccum Cleaner robot. (dusting is terrible boring)
- Fix my toy helicopter. (maybe it's just the tail rotor)
- Fix my coffee machine. (that has exploded)
- Fix my bicycle. (that's something wrong with the back wheel)
- Organize my Github repositories and old codes. (like, from 2018, gees)
- Fix anything that I can.

Besides this, I'm working on a congress paper in aeroelasticity of plates (which IDK if it is going to happen), and having Italian classes, _ce mi piace cos√¨ tanto_.

So, that's it! In the middle of those chaotic times, I'm just trying to do my best with myself.
